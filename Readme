CALCULATING AREAS AND VOLUMES

Let’s calculate and display the area and the deposition.
Area can be calculated with ‘vertical * horizontal’ and volume can be calculated by 'area * height’.
Calculate the three areas and volumes using the information in the table below.
Rectangular Class is a child class of Rectangle Class.
Functions to make are as below
□ calc_area() *Rectangle Class
Parameter:	self
Content:	Calculate	area	and	display	calculation	results.
□ calc_volume() *Rectangular Class
Parameter:	self
Content:	Calculate	volume	and	display	calculation	results.
□ create_instance()
Content:	Create	3	instances	of	square	as	above,	add	them	to	global	list	‘squares’
□ play()
Content:	Summarize	the	contents	to	be	executed.

【Executed outcome】
vertical horizontal height
3 4 5
50 60 70
333 444 555
Area is 12
Volume is 60
Area is 3000
Volume is 210000
Area is 147852
Volume is 82057860
